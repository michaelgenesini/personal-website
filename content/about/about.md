I'm Michael, a tinkerer at heart. I'm curious about understanding how things work and obsessed with fixing them—in code, in teams, in everyday life.

I'm Italian, based in Milan with my wife. We're slow digital nomads—we spend 3-6 months at a time in different places, at least once a year. We have a van I customized into an RV for roadtrips around Italy and Europe. I speak English and Spanish fluently, learning Portuguese.

I'm an introvert. I value meaningful conversations over small talk. I care about kindness and moving at a calm pace—but I move when it matters.

I care deeply about environmentalism and sustainability. I'm vegetarian—mainly for environmental reasons, but also animal rights.

Outside work, I'm rebuilding my reading habit and trying to build a writing one. Boxing three times a week keeps me grounded and active. I play percussion when the mood strikes.

Professionally, I've been in software since 2015, starting as a frontend developer. Now I'm an Engineering Manager at [Cabify](https://cabify.com), leading the B2B mobility and ads teams. My technical background keeps me hands-on, which is how I like to work—helping teams succeed by fixing what's broken.

I have a creative side—I care about aesthetics and design—which shapes how I think about products, even though I was never formally trained.

I (try to) meditate everyday 🧘‍♂️
