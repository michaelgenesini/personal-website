My name is Michael Genesini. I'm Italian and as per the
stereotype I love pizza. Well, maybe a little bit more than the
average considering I got it tattooed on my sleeve.

I'm definitely an introvert (INFP-A) and I struggle to get to
know new people because of it, but I really love to get
meaningful mental connections with other human beings.

I've been working professionally in the software industry since
2015, overlapping for some months with my master's degree in
computer science engineering. In 2021 I started my journey as
Engineering Manager which I fell in love with.

When I'm not working, I do outdoor activities. Mainly walking
and hiking on the marvelous Orobic mountains, but also
bouldering and slacklining. I tend to try a lot of different
hobbies because I get quickly excited about new things. To name
a few: playing board games with friends, learning Arabic and
Portuguese, learning Go (Weiqi), playing Djembè, tending a
terrarium.

I'm a super slow reader and I have a hard time keeping
consistency on my reading pace. I'm trying now to schedule
specific moments of my day for that, and I avoid having hard
goals for "number of books" to relieve the stress of being so
slow.

I also struggle with keeping a personal knowledge base for the
things I read. I would really love keeping a Zettelkasten but I
haven't found a good workflow yet.

I meditate every day 🧘
