A couple of years ago I decided to buy a Casio. Not for a fancy trend. I just wanted to avoid using my phone to check the time. I noticed I was relying on my phone even for such a stupid thing like checking the time. I was always carrying my phone with me. All the time. That's just crazy. So, I bought a Casio, the [AE-1200WH](https://www.casio.com/us/watches/casio/product.AE-1200WH-1AV/) which has 5 alarms and a cool design with the world map with time zones.

Then after a while I noticed it was 2 minutes earlier. I always have the beep sound every hour, so it was beeping at X o'clock, but it was actually still 58. I just kept it like that.

It's funny because now I live 2 minutes earlier all the time. I hear the beep, and I start doing the thing. When I have a meeting, and I hear the beep, I go back to the desk or I switch context for that meeting.

I thought eventually I would get used and just be on time or late, but it didn't happen. When I have to go out at a time, I check my watch and for some reason my mind just use the time I see. I go out, maybe even in a rush, and then on the way there, I realize I have a couple of minute more, so I can enjoy the "way there".
